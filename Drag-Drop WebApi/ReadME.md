#Enhancements:
-- Add a start and end screen;
-- Add a counter that would count the number of attempts;
-- Add a countdown timer that would not limit the number of attempts, but rather the time available for us to complete our puzzle game;
-- Add more questions;
-- Add a leaderboard (weâ€™d need to persist our data somehow);
-- Refactor the logic of our game so that we can keep the questions and the order of words in a simple JS object;
-- Fetch the questions from a remote API.
